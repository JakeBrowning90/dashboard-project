# dashboard-project

This is a concept for an admin dashboard page, made as part of my learning on The Odin Project. The page is primarily structured using CSS Grid, though I supplemented it with Flexbox in a few instances where I was working in 1 dimension. 

I ran into several challenges while building this page, particularly concerning scaling images and text when resizing the window. I worked through this by using properties like "object-fit: cover" for the food images, along with the "auto-fit" and "minmax()" values for positioning the recipe cards into neat rows and columns.
